Okay, let's break down the errors and formulate a plan to tackle them systematically.

The errors fall into three main categories:

1.  **TypeScript Type Errors (`tsc --noEmit`):** These are critical as they prevent the code from compiling correctly. They mostly seem related to component prop types, especially around the `IgnorePatterns` component and its integration, likely stemming from the recent refactoring attempts.
2.  **ESLint React Hook Warnings (`react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`):** These indicate potential bugs related to stale closures or unnecessary re-renders in `useEffect` and `useCallback` hooks.
3.  **ESLint Unused Variable Warnings (`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`):** These point to potentially dead code or incomplete implementations. While not critical for starting the app, cleaning them up improves code maintainability.

The core issue preventing the app from starting is likely the **TypeScript errors**. We should prioritize those. The ignore pattern refactoring seems to have caused inconsistencies between how components expect props (`IgnorePatternsProps`, `ExtendedSidebarProps`) and how they are being used or defined.

Here's a proposed debugging strategy checklist:

### Debugging Strategy Checklist

**Phase 1: Resolve TypeScript Compilation Errors (High Priority)**

*   [x] **Analyze `IgnorePatternsProps` Mismatches:**
    *   [x] Review the `IgnorePatternsProps` interface definition in `src/components/IgnorePatterns.tsx`.
    *   [x] Compare the defined props with those being passed in `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` (line 646). Fix the props being passed (e.g., pass `globalPatternsState`, `localPatternsState`, `onExcludedSystemPatternsChange` instead of `globalIgnorePatterns`, `localIgnorePatterns`, etc.).
    *   [x] Update the component calls within `src/components/__tests__/IgnorePatterns.test.tsx` to match the correct `IgnorePatternsProps` interface, providing the required state objects and callbacks.
*   [x] **Fix `excludedSystemPatterns` Access in `App.tsx`:**
    *   [x] Go to `src/App.tsx` line 278.
    *   [x] Inspect the return type of `parseIgnorePatternsContent`.
    *   [x] Correct the code to access the intended property (likely `excludedPatterns` based on the function definition in `src/utils/patternUtils.ts`).
*   [x] **Address `SearchBar` Prop Type Issue:**
    *   [x] Investigate the errors in `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` (lines 401, 584) where `SearchBar` is rendered.
    *   [x] Verify the props interface used by the `SearchBar` component definition. Ensure it's using its own `SearchBarProps` (defined in `src/types/FileTypes.ts`) and not accidentally typed as `ExtendedSidebarProps`.
    *   [x] Correct the type definition for the `SearchBar` component if it's wrong.
*   [x] **Fix Missing `content` Property in `FileList.tsx`:**
    *   [x] Go to `src/components/FileList.tsx` line 32.
    *   [x] Determine why `FileCard` requires `content` but `FileList` receives files of type `Omit<FileData, 'content'>`.
    *   [x] Decide on a fix:
        *   [x] Option B: Modify `FileList` to fetch content for selected files before rendering `FileCard` (might require async operations).

**Phase 2: Address ESLint Hook Warnings (Medium Priority)**

*   [ ] **`IgnorePatterns.tsx` `useMemo` Suggestion:**
    *   [ ] Wrap the `excludedSystemPatterns` logical expression (or its derivation if complex) inside a `useMemo` hook as suggested by the ESLint warning (line 89) to prevent it from changing on every render.
*   [ ] **`App.tsx` Missing Dependency:**
    *   [ ] Review the `useEffect` hook at `src/App.tsx` line 299.
    *   [ ] Evaluate if `applyFiltersAndSort` should be added to the dependency array. If `applyFiltersAndSort` itself depends on state that changes, adding it might be necessary. If it's stable, consider if the linter rule can be safely ignored for this line *with a comment explaining why*.

**Phase 3: Clean Up Unused Variables (Low Priority)**

*   [ ] **Review `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`:**
    *   [ ] Go through each unused variable warning reported by ESLint.
    *   [ ] For each warning:
        *   [ ] If the variable/prop/type is genuinely unused, remove it.
        *   [ ] If it's part of an incomplete feature, add a `// TODO:` comment or finish implementing its usage.
        *   [ ] Pay close attention to unused props in `Sidebar.tsx` and `SearchBar.tsx` related to ignore patterns â€“ this might indicate incomplete refactoring.

**Phase 4: Verification and Testing**

*   [x] **Run Type Checking:** After applying fixes, run `tsc --noEmit` again to ensure all TypeScript errors are resolved.
*   [x] **Run Linter:** Run `npm run lint` to check if warnings are resolved or reduced.
*   [ ] **Start Application:** Attempt to start the application (`npm start` or similar). Verify it launches without crashing.
*   [ ] **Test Core Functionality:**
    *   [ ] Test folder selection and file display.
    *   [ ] Test file selection/deselection (individual, folder, select/deselect all).
    *   [ ] **Crucially, test the ignore patterns functionality:**
        *   [ ] Saving/loading global patterns.
        *   [ ] Saving/loading local patterns for the selected folder.
        *   [ ] Toggling system default patterns.
        *   [ ] Verify that ignored files are correctly excluded from the file tree and selection counts/token counts.
        *   [ ] Test resetting and clearing patterns.
*   [ ] **Run Automated Tests:** Run the test suite (`npm test` or equivalent) and fix any failures, especially in `IgnorePatterns.test.tsx`.

This plan prioritizes getting the app running again by fixing the blocking TypeScript errors first, then addresses potential runtime issues from hook warnings, and finally cleans up the codebase. Remember to commit changes frequently during this process.
