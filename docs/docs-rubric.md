| **1. Installation and Setup**  | Comprehensive, clear, step-by-step instructions for all supported platforms (if applicable). Covers prerequisites, download, installation, and initial launch flawlessly. Addresses potential setup issues proactively. | Clear instructions covering main installation path. Minor ambiguities might exist for edge cases or less common platforms. Prerequisites are listed.        | Basic installation steps are present but may lack detail or clarity for some users. Prerequisites might be unclear or missing.                        | Instructions are incomplete, confusing, or contain errors making setup difficult. Key steps or prerequisites are missing.                    | Instructions are significantly flawed, leading to installation failures or major confusion. Very difficult to follow.                           | Installation/setup instructions are missing entirely or are fundamentally incorrect and unusable.                                            |
| **2. UI and Workflow**         | Thorough walkthrough of the entire user interface (file tree, selection controls, action buttons). Explains the core workflow of selecting files and generating context intuitively with clear visuals (screenshots/GIFs). | Good overview of the UI and main workflow. Most common actions are explained well. Some less frequent interactions might lack detail. Visuals are present. | Basic UI elements are identified, and the core workflow is described, but steps may be unclear or visuals lacking. Assumes significant user intuition. | UI elements are mentioned, but their function or the workflow is poorly explained or confusing. Significant gaps in explaining how to use the app. | Major UI components or core workflow steps are omitted or described inaccurately. Very difficult to understand basic operation.                | Explanation of the UI and workflow is missing, completely inaccurate, or incomprehensible.                                                  |
| **3. Configuration Options**   | Detailed explanation of all configuration options (e.g., Ignore Patterns syntax/scope, Output Formats). Provides clear examples and explains the impact of each option on the final output. Addresses global vs. local patterns clearly. | Good explanation of configuration options with basic examples. Covers the main purpose of ignore patterns and output formats. Minor details might be missed. | Mentions configuration options but explanations are superficial or lack examples. The distinction between global/local patterns might be unclear.   | Configuration options are listed but poorly explained or lack practical examples. Difficult to understand how to configure the app effectively. | Significant configuration options are missing, or explanations are inaccurate/confusing. Configuration is effectively impossible based on docs. | Configuration options are not documented, or the documentation is entirely misleading.                                                       |
| **4. Context Optimization**    | Exceptionally clear explanation of code compression, comment removal (incl. docstring option), and token counting features. Details *why* these are crucial for AI context, potential trade-offs, and provides best-practice examples. | Good explanation of optimization features, covering their purpose and basic usage (e.g., enabling/disabling). May lack depth on trade-offs or nuanced use. | Mentions optimization features but explanation lacks clarity on the benefits for AI prompting or how to use them effectively.                     | Optimization features are mentioned but poorly explained, confusing, or lack practical guidance. Purpose remains unclear.                   | Optimization features described with significant inaccuracies or critical omissions. Very difficult to understand or use these features.        | Context optimization features (compression, comments, tokens) are completely missing or fundamentally misrepresented.                         |
| **5. Guidance on Effective AI Prompting** | Provides excellent, specific advice on leveraging the app's features (context selection, optimization) for effective AI prompts. Includes examples tailored to common coding tasks (review, generation, debugging). Connects tool usage to prompt quality. | Offers good general advice on structuring prompts using the tool's context, with some relevant examples. May not fully link specific features (like compression) to prompt outcomes. | Basic, generic prompting advice is present but lacks specific connection to the app's unique capabilities or context generation workflow.        | Prompting advice is minimal, vague, or potentially misleading in the context of the tool. Fails to guide users on using the generated output. | Guidance is present but confusing, inaccurate, or irrelevant to using the context generated by this specific application.                  | No guidance is provided on how to effectively use the generated context for AI prompting, defeating a core purpose of the application.           |
| **6. Clarity and Language**    | Writing is exceptionally clear, concise, and precise. Uses appropriate terminology consistently. Free of grammatical errors and typos. Language is perfectly suited for the target developer audience.             | Writing is clear and generally easy to understand. Uses mostly appropriate terminology. Minimal grammatical errors or typos are present.              | Writing is mostly understandable but may contain jargon, awkward phrasing, or minor inconsistencies. Some grammatical errors/typos noticeable.   | Writing is often unclear, verbose, or ambiguous. Contains noticeable grammatical errors or typos that hinder understanding.                 | Writing is very difficult to understand due to poor clarity, incorrect terminology, and frequent errors.                                  | Writing is incomprehensible, filled with errors, or completely inappropriate for the audience.                                               |
| **7. Structure and Navigation** | Documentation is logically structured with a clear hierarchy (e.g., ToC, sections). Navigation is intuitive and efficient. Information is easy to find via search or browsing. Cross-references are used effectively. | Good structure and organization. Navigation is mostly clear. Information can generally be found with reasonable effort. Some cross-references exist. | Basic structure is present, but organization may be inconsistent or navigation slightly confusing. Finding specific information may take some time. | Structure is illogical or inconsistent. Navigation is difficult, and finding information requires significant effort. Search may be ineffective. | Lack of clear structure or navigation. Information is scattered and very hard to locate. Effectively unusable for quick reference.           | No discernible structure or navigation. A chaotic collection of information or completely disorganized.                                      |
| **8. Completeness and Accuracy** | Documentation covers all application features, configuration options, and common use cases thoroughly and accurately. Information is up-to-date with the current application version. Edge cases are considered. | Covers most major features and options accurately. Minor features or specific configurations might be omitted or lack detail. Mostly up-to-date.    | Covers core features but may have noticeable gaps in coverage or minor inaccuracies. May be slightly outdated.                                  | Significant features or options are missing, or the information provided contains notable inaccuracies. Clearly outdated in parts.             | Documentation is severely incomplete, inaccurate, or significantly outdated. Provides a misleading view of the application.                   | Documentation is fundamentally incomplete or inaccurate, rendering it useless or harmful.                                                      |
