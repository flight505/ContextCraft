# PasteMax Todo List

Help that can be used to finish the tasks and application. 
The old pastemax repo is here: https://github.com/kleneway/pastemax/pull/16/commits fix: improve directory loading and path handling#16 not compleatly impllimented into the new repo yet. 
and https://github.com/kleneway/pastemax/pull/20 (Fixed Reload, Folder Select/Deselect automatically select/deselect all files in it (WINDOWS 11), Improved Project loading, improved path normalisation) #20
also the old repo has a lot of testing and other stuff that can be used to solve some issues in the new repo. 

repomix is a tool very similar to pastemax but focused on CLI were pastemax is a electron app. 
the url is https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix we are taking a lot of inspiration from this project. 

We have a test repo with depth of 4 levels and 15 directories and 13 files.
the url is https://github.com/flight505/test-project it is public and will be used for testing.
The test repo tree is like this:

# **PasteMax + Repomix-Style: Final Very Detailed Implementation Checklist (Electron Integration)**

Below is the **consolidated** and **up-to-date** checklist merging:
1. **Step 1: Remote & Local Git Repository Handling (Electron Integration)** (for loading local repos with `.git`, remote GitHub repos, plus branch selection using `isomorphic-git`), and  
2. The **Advanced Implementation** plan (covering code compression, multiple output formats, prompt templates, and new LLM model integration).

All items are broken into **one-story-point** tasks. This ensures a **competent AI Coding Agent** can implement these step by step for PasteMax’s **Electron + React** architecture. **No detail is omitted**.

---

## **STEP 1: REMOTE & LOCAL GIT REPOSITORY HANDLING (ELECTRON INTEGRATION)**

### **1.1 Add or Select Working Folder (Local/Remote)**
- [ ] **UI Folder/Repo Selection**  
  - [ ] In **PasteMax’s main interface** (Electron + React), reuse or create a folder selection component.  
  - [ ] The user can **pick a local path** (via system file dialog) or **enter a remote GitHub URL**.  
  - [ ] If **local path** has a `.git/` subdirectory, mark as Git-managed (enable advanced Git features).  
    - [ ] `fs.existsSync('.git')` or similar to detect.  
    - [ ] If found, we can later list branches, commits, etc.  
  - [ ] If **remote** (like `owner/repo`, `owner/repo#branch`, or a full GitHub URL), proceed to the clone/fetch logic.  
  - [ ] Add a **standardized UI button** labeled “Select Repository” or “Open Repo” (imported from `ui/components/Button` if you have a shared library).

### **1.2 Parse Repository Input (Remote Only)**
- [ ] **Parsing Utility**  
  - [ ] A function `parseGitHubUrl(input: string)` that extracts:
    - `owner` (the string before `/`)
    - `repo` (the string after `/`)
    - optional `branch` or `commit` if `#branch` or `tree/branch`/`commit/...` is found
  - [ ] Check validity: If it doesn’t match known patterns, show “Invalid repository syntax.”
  - [ ] If no branch is provided, default to `"main"` or `"master"`.
  - [ ] Example inputs:
    - `owner/repo`
    - `owner/repo#dev`
    - `https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/someBranch`
    - `https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/123abc`

### **1.3 Clone/Fetch Remote Repo with isomorphic-git**
- [ ] **In Electron Main Process**  
  - [ ] Implement `cloneRemoteRepo({ owner, repo, branch })`:
    - [ ] Use **isomorphic-git** to do a shallow clone to a temp folder: `os.tmpdir() + '/pasteMax-' + uuid()`
    - [ ] If `branch` or `commit` is provided, attempt checkout.  
    - [ ] If invalid branch/commit, show “Branch/commit not found.”  
    - [ ] If it’s private or credentials required, show “Private repo or invalid access.”
  - [ ] Set `depth: 1` for shallow clone.  

### **1.4 Progress Indicator**
- [ ] **Remote Repo Loading UI**  
  - [ ] Once “Load” is clicked for remote, show a spinner labeled “Cloning remote repository...”  
  - [ ] If isomorphic-git provides progress events (e.g., `onProgress`), update status text.  
  - [ ] On success, hide spinner and proceed to file scanning.

### **1.5 Error Handling & Retry**
- [ ] **Network & Repo Errors**  
  - [ ] Catch clone failures. If 404 or network offline, show “Could not clone repository. Check URL or connection.”  
  - [ ] Let user retry or fix the URL.  
  - [ ] If user cancels mid-download, clean up partial data in the temp folder.

### **1.6 File Tree Population**
- [ ] **After Clone or Local Folder**  
  - [ ] If local folder has `.git`, skip clone but proceed to scanning.  
    - [ ] If multiple branches exist, allow user to choose one (below).  
  - [ ] Use PasteMax’s **existing scanning** to build a file tree:
    - [ ] Respect `.gitignore` if user wants.  
    - [ ] Exclude binary files.  
  - [ ] Display the new file tree in the main interface.  
  - [ ] If a different branch is selected (below), re-checkout and re-scan.

### **1.7 Implement Branch Switching (Local Git)**
- [ ] **Branch Selection**  
  - [ ] If `.git/` is found locally, list branches with `isomorphic-git listBranches`.  
  - [ ] Provide a dropdown in the UI. On selection: `isomorphic-git checkout` that branch.  
  - [ ] Rescan folder; update the file tree.  
  - [ ] Show “Currently on branch: <branchName>” label somewhere in the UI.

### **1.8 UI Integration with Repository Handling**
- [ ] **Repository Selection Integration**  
  - [ ] Leverage existing "Select Folder" in FileTreeHeader for local repositories
  - [ ] When local folder has `.git/`, automatically detect it and enable Git features  
  - [ ] Add minimal UI for entering remote GitHub URLs when needed
  - [ ] Use `isomorphic-git` for all Git operations to maintain pure JavaScript implementation
- [ ] **Branch Handling UI**  
  - [ ] Only show branch selector when a Git repository is detected
  - [ ] Display current branch name in the UI
  - [ ] Provide branch switching capability via dropdown
  - [ ] Update file tree automatically when branch is changed

### **1.9 Testing & Validation**
- [ ] **Local Repo**  
  - [ ] Open a local `.git` folder. Confirm branches are listed. Switch branches, see file tree change.
- [ ] **Remote Repo**  
  - [ ] E.g., `owner/repo#dev-branch`. Confirm it clones dev-branch.  
  - [ ] Full commit URL checks out that commit.  
- [ ] **Progress & Errors**  
  - [ ] Ensure spinner shows during clone, error on invalid input, correct file scanning on success.

---

## **STEP 2: CODE COMPRESSION (REPOMIX-STYLE)**

### **2.1 Compression Toggle/UI**
- [ ] **Add “Compress Code” Checkbox**  
  - [ ] In Settings or near the file list, label it “Compress Code (Repomix-like).”
  - [ ] When checked, included files undergo code compression before final usage.

### **2.2 Tree-Sitter/Parser Integration**
- [ ] **Install**  
  - [ ] `npm install tree-sitter tree-sitter-javascript ...` (for languages).  
  - [ ] Handle native module rebuild for Electron if needed.
- [ ] **Implement `compressCode(source, extension)`**  
  - [ ] If recognized language, parse the AST, remove function bodies, keep signatures.  
  - [ ] If unknown extension or parse error, fallback to partial compression or skip.

### **2.3 Fallback for Unsupported Files**
- [ ] **Naive Approach**  
  - [ ] For unrecognized languages, just include them uncompressed or do line-based minimal compression.  
  - [ ] Mark them with “(Not compressed)” in the final output if needed.

### **2.4 Comment Handling**
- [ ] **Optional**  
  - [ ] If user also selects “Remove Comments,” do it in the parse or via a regex pass.  
  - [ ] Keep docstrings if desired, or strip all comments.

### **2.5 Token Counting Post-Compression**
- [ ] **Recount**  
  - [ ] After compression, re-check the token usage for that file.  
  - [ ] Update “Total tokens: X” in the UI if we do real-time token counting.

### **2.6 UI Feedback & Testing**
- [ ] **Indicator**  
  - [ ] Show “Compressing file 3/15” if multiple files are big.  
  - [ ] Compare final code snippet in the output to confirm placeholders replaced function bodies.
- [ ] **Performance**  
  - [ ] For large repos, ensure compression runs asynchronously.

---

## **STEP 3: ADVANCED OUTPUT FORMAT (XML/MARKDOWN/PLAIN)**

### **3.1 Format Selector UI**
- [ ] **Dropdown**: “Output Format” with “XML,” “Markdown,” or “Plain.”  
  - [ ] Default “XML,” or remember last used.  
  - [ ] On change, we’ll reformat the final output (in the “Pack Repo” step).

### **3.2 Implement XML Formatting**
- [ ] **`formatAsXML(files, config)`**  
  - [ ] Optionally start with `<?xml version="1.0"?>`.  
  - [ ] `<file_summary>` for metadata or user instructions.  
  - [ ] `<directory_structure>` listing the tree.  
  - [ ] `<files>` with `<file path="...">Content</file>` for each.  
  - [ ] Escape or wrap code in CDATA.  
  - [ ] If `output.instructionFilePath`, append `<instruction>` with that file’s text.

### **3.3 Implement Markdown Formatting**
- [ ] **`formatAsMarkdown(files, config)`**  
  - [ ] `# File Summary`, `# Directory Structure` (maybe a code block listing).  
  - [ ] `# Files`, then `## File: path` with fenced code blocks.  
  - [ ] If instructions present, “# Instruction” at the end.

### **3.4 Implement Plain Text Formatting**
- [ ] **`formatAsPlain(files, config)`**  
  - [ ] ASCII separators: `==================\nFile Summary`.  
  - [ ] Then “Directory Structure” (list each file/folder).  
  - [ ] Then “Files” with blocks like:
    ```
    =============
    File: path
    =============
    content
    ```  
  - [ ] “Instruction” if present.

### **3.5 Preview & Copy**
- [ ] **UI Panel**  
  - [ ] Once user picks a format, show a text preview or “View Output” button.  
  - [ ] Possibly let them “Copy to Clipboard” or “Save As...”.

### **3.6 Edge Cases**
- [ ] **Markdown with triple backticks inside code** → escape them.  
- [ ] **Invalid XML** → ensure we do CDATA or escape.  
- [ ] Large code. Consider performance or streaming.

---

## **STEP 4: PROMPT TEMPLATE SELECTOR**

### **4.1 Static Template Definitions**
- [ ] **Predefine**  
  - [ ] A small array or JSON: `[ {id:'codeReview', name:'Code Review', content:'...'}, ... ]`.  
  - [ ] Include “Documentation Generation,” “Test Case Generation,” etc.

### **4.2 UI for Template Selection**
- [ ] **Dropdown or Button**  
  - [ ] “Select Prompt Template” near the user’s custom prompt input.
  - [ ] use the same dropdown component for the prompt template as the one for the model selection. or a multiple select dropdown.
- [ ] We have a dropdown in the ui/components/Button.tsx file.
- [ ] **Dropdown** near the user instructions input field.
  - [ ] Rebuild the final preview on change.

### **4.3 Insert Template into Prompt**
- [ ] **Overwrite or Append**  
  - [ ] If user picks a template, fill the prompt text area with that content.  
  - [ ] If they had text already, ask “Replace existing or append?”

### **4.4 Editing & Persistence**
- [ ] **User can tweak**  
  - [ ] Let them modify the inserted text.  
  - [ ] Possibly store the last chosen template in local config.

### **4.5 Testing Template Logic**
- [ ] **Integration**  
  - [ ] The final prompt block (e.g. `<instruction>` in XML) includes this template text.  
  - [ ] Validate with each template.
### **4.6 Prompt Template to hardcode**
- [ ] **Prompt Template to hardcode**
  - [ ] We have the following templates for Code Review, Architecture Review, Security Review, Performance Review, and Code Quality which we will add to the prompt template.
<PROMPT_TEMPLATE>

## **STEP 5: MODEL INFORMATION FROM OPENROUTER**

### **5.1 Fetch Model List**
- [ ] **Public Endpoint**: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`.  
  - [ ] Do a fetch on app startup or when opening the “Model Selection” UI.

### **5.2 Extract Key Fields**
- [ ] **Parse**  
  - [ ] For each model, store `id`, `name`, `context_length`.  
  - [ ] Skip cost/pricing.

### **5.3 Dynamic Model Dropdown**
- [ ] **Replace Hard-coded**  
  - [ ] Instead of manual “GPT-3.5 / Claude 2,” show fetched list.  
  - [ ] If fetch fails, fallback to `[ {id:"openai/gpt-4o"}, {id:"anthropic/claude-3.5"}]`.

### **5.4 Handle Model Selection**
- [ ] **Global State**  
  - [ ] “selectedModelID” and “context_length” in the app’s React state.  
  - [ ] If user changes model, update token limit logic.

### **5.5 Token Limit Awareness**
- [ ] **Use Model’s `context_length`**  
  - [ ] If total tokens > model limit, show a warning. Possibly suggest compression.  
  - [ ] Test with a big code snippet.

### **5.6 Test**
- [ ] **Try**  
  - [ ] A known large context model e.g. “Claude 3.5” (200k). Confirm token meter updates.  
  - [ ] If offline, fallback to default.

---

## **STEP 6: UPDATE TO CURRENT LLMS (GPT-4O & CLAUDE 3.5)**

### **6.1 Deprecate Old Models**
- [ ] **Remove** references to `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `claude-2`.  
- [ ] **Rename** them to `openai/gpt-4o` or `anthropic/claude-3.5`.

### **6.2 Check API Calls**
- [ ] **OpenRouter**  
  - [ ] If using `model: "openai/gpt-4o"` or `"anthropic/claude-3.5"`, confirm the chat format is role-based.  
  - [ ] Ensure no legacy parameters are used.

### **6.3 Test**
- [ ] **Manual Query**  
  - [ ] If there’s a “Send to AI” feature in PasteMax, try sending the final code prompt. See if GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 respond properly.

---

## **STEP 7: INTEGRATE NEW FEATURES INTO PASTEMAX UI**

### **7.1 Remote vs. Local Switch**
- [ ] **UI**  
  - [ ] Tab or toggle: “Local Repo” vs. “Remote GitHub.”  
  - [ ] If remote, show the text input. If local, show file dialog.

### **7.2 File Selection & Tree**
- [ ] **Unified**  
  - [ ] For local or remote, display the same tree component.  
  - [ ] Check/uncheck files for inclusion.

### **7.3 Compression Toggle**
- [ ] **Place** next to “Output Format,” labeled “Compress Code?”  
  - [ ] Update real-time token usage if toggled.

### **7.4 Output Format Selector**
- [ ] **Dropdown** near the prompt text or advanced settings.  
  - [ ] Rebuild the final preview on change.

### **7.5 Prompt Template Dropdown**
- [ ] **Insert** selected template into user’s instruction box.  
  - [ ] Possibly in the same panel as compression/format?

### **7.6 Model Selector**
- [ ] **Dropdown** for the OpenRouter models.  
  - [ ] Display context length.  
  - [ ] If offline fetch fails, fallback to `[ "openai/gpt-4o", "anthropic/claude-3.5"]`.

### **7.7 Token Counter**
- [ ] **Display**: “Tokens: X / Y.”  
  - [ ] Warn if near limit.

### **7.8 Save/Send Prompt Flow**
- [ ] **Generate Prompt** with chosen format + compression + instructions.  
- [ ] **Send to AI** (if that feature is present) calls the endpoint with role-based messages.

### **7.9 UI Consistency & Theming**
- [ ] **Dark Mode** check, layout tidiness, advanced panel for large repos, etc.

---

## **STEP 8: (OPTIONAL) CLI CONFIG & REPOMIX COMPATIBILITY**

### **8.1 Internal Config Representation**
- [ ] **`PasteMaxConfig`** structure with:
  - `remoteRepo`, `branch`, `outputFormat`, `compress`, `selectedPromptTemplate`, `customPromptText`, `selectedModel`, etc.

### **8.2 Load config**
- [ ] **If** `repomix.config.json` found, parse.  
  - [ ] Map `output.style` → `outputFormat`, `compress` → boolean, etc.  
  - [ ] Update the UI states accordingly.

### **8.3 Export config**
- [ ] **“Save Config”** button that writes a new file or merges with existing.  
  - [ ] Could name it `repomix.config.json` for cross-tool compatibility.

### **8.4 Use config**
- [ ] On opening a project, if `repomix.config.json` is found, auto-apply.  
- [ ] Document any partial mismatches if advanced features differ from Repomix’s.

---

## **STEP 9: TESTING & UX FEEDBACK (COMPREHENSIVE)**

### **9.1 Test Remote Repo with Branch**
- [ ] **Example**: `owner/repo#dev-branch`. Confirm correct branch is checked out.  
- [ ] Confirm file tree matches that branch’s content.

### **9.2 Test Compression**
- [ ] **Large Functions**: enable “Compress Code,” check placeholders.  
- [ ] Compare token counts with/without compress.

### **9.3 Test Each Output Format**
- [ ] **XML**: valid tags, `<file_summary>`, `<files>`, `<instruction>`.  
- [ ] **Markdown**: headings, fenced code blocks.  
- [ ] **Plain**: ASCII dividers.  

### **9.4 Test Prompt Templates**
- [ ] Insert “Code Review” template, see if it appears in the final output.  
- [ ] Possibly send to an LLM, confirm it references the snippet.

### **9.5 Test Model Selection**
- [ ] Fetch from OpenRouter, pick `gpt-4o`. Send a small code snippet.  
- [ ] Try `claude-3.5` with a bigger snippet (maybe 50k tokens).  
- [ ] If offline, fallback to the default array.

### **9.6 Validate GPT-4o & Claude 3.5**
- [ ] No old references to `gpt-3.5` or `claude-2`.  
- [ ] Possibly use system messages if recommended.

### **9.7 Over-Limit Scenarios**
- [ ] If code is huge, total tokens > model limit. Warn or forcibly compress more.

### **9.8 UI & Theming**
- [ ] **Dark Mode** test, no layout breaks.

### **9.9 Performance Check**
- [ ] Big repos: measure scanning, compression times. Possibly add a progress bar.

### **9.10 Final Bug Fix & Documentation**
- [ ] **Docs**: update README with new remote loading steps, compression, format selection, GPT-4o/Claude3.5 usage.  
- [ ] Merge all short-lived feature branches in sequence (remote, compression, output formats, etc.).  
- [ ] Tag a release once all tests pass.

---

## **Completion & Summary**
By following these **unchecked tasks**, PasteMax becomes a powerful Electron + React tool, replicating **Repomix**-style code compression and multi-format output, plus local/remote Git integration and the latest GPT-4o/Claude 3.5 model usage. Every detail is specified so a **capable AI** can autonomously implement:

1. **Local & Remote Git** with branch switching  
2. **Code compression** preserving function signatures  
3. **Config-based** advanced ignore patterns & output style  
4. **Multiple output styles** (XML, Markdown, Plain text)  
5. **Prompt templates** for AI instructions  
6. **Model selection** from OpenRouter  
7. **New GPT-4o & Claude 3.5** integration  
8. **Thorough testing** for performance & user experience.
