| **1. Mac-Like Visual Consistency**           | Flawlessly mirrors macOS design principles (window chrome, minimal chrome effects, typography) with zero “web-app” giveaways; UI elements integrate seamlessly with Apple’s visual language.                        | Strong macOS influence with only subtle web-based artifacts; mostly cohesive and recognizable as a near-native look.                                                                   | Some macOS styling cues, but noticeable web-like patterns or inconsistent fonts/icons compromise the native feel.                                                                  | Minimal macOS styling; interface noticeably resembles a web page. Window controls or fonts don’t match macOS standards.                                                             | MacOS design is scarcely followed; obvious Electron defaults dominate, making it clearly a web application wrapper.                                                                   | No mac-like styling at all; entirely a generic or mismatched interface that clashes with user expectations on macOS.                                                                |
| **2. Minimal UI & Layout**                   | Layout is elegantly simple, clutter-free, and logically organized, prioritizing readability and minimal visual distractions; every component has a clear function and place.                                       | Generally minimal and clean; a few minor instances of clutter or non-ideal spacing, but the overall look remains streamlined.                                                          | Moderately simple, but some unnecessary elements or inconsistent spacing create mild visual noise.                                                                                 | Layout is somewhat cluttered, with extraneous elements that reduce clarity; minimalism is not consistently applied.                                                                  | Layout feels chaotic, with scattered elements lacking a unifying principle; the design is far from minimal or clear.                                                                  | Utterly disorganized; no effort toward minimalism or layout logic, resulting in a visually confusing, poorly structured UI.                                                         |
| **3. Theming & Light/Dark Mode**             | Flawless monochromatic palette that translates beautifully between light and dark modes; color contrasts and highlights are precise, ensuring a refined and consistent experience in both themes.                  | Solid light/dark themes with cohesive color usage; minor inconsistencies in certain UI sections or slight mismatch in text-to-background contrast.                                   | Light and dark modes exist, but color usage can be patchy or inconsistent; some text or elements might be harder to see in one mode than the other.                                 | Light/dark mode support is partial or poorly integrated; certain UI elements remain unthemed or clash with the overall color palette.                                               | Minimal attempt at color theming; the application looks mismatched or glaring in at least one mode (light or dark), compromising user comfort.                                        | No workable theming strategy; light and dark modes are either broken, absent, or create a visually unusable interface.                                                              |
| **4. Performance & Smoothness**              | Interactions, animations, and window operations all run with near-native responsiveness; minimal resource overhead ensures the UI feels instantly reactive and polished.                                          | Generally smooth, with rare performance hiccups only under heavy load; overall experience remains responsive.                                                                        | Performance is acceptable for routine tasks, but noticeable lag or stuttering appears during more complex operations (e.g., switching modes, opening modals).                       | Frequent slowdowns, choppy animations, or high resource usage hamper everyday interactions, making the Electron base obvious.                                                       | Substantial performance issues or jarring stutters degrade user perception; the app’s responsiveness feels far below macOS norms.                                                    | App consistently freezes or lags, creating a severely disrupted experience that is effectively unusable for any significant length of time.                                          |
| **5. Interaction & Feedback**                | Hover, focus, click, and transition states follow native macOS conventions; all controls provide responsive visual or haptic feedback, making user actions feel fluid and intuitive.                               | Provides generally snappy, clear feedback on user actions; slight inconsistencies may occur, but overall meets user expectations for a desktop app.                                  | Basic feedback is present (e.g., button highlights), but may lack subtle transitions or consistent animations for a truly cohesive desktop feel.                                    | Most controls offer limited or delayed feedback, making certain interactions ambiguous or unrefined (e.g., uncertain hover states, missing transitions).                              | Feedback is scant or nonexistent, causing user confusion over whether an action was registered; the interface feels clunky or unresponsive.                                          | No meaningful feedback on clicks or input; the UI fails to acknowledge user actions, breaking fundamental usability.                                                                |
| **6. OS Integration & Native Behaviors**     | Complies deeply with macOS norms (menus, keyboard shortcuts, system dialogs); seamlessly supports drag-and-drop, share sheets, or platform notifications with minimal friction.                                    | Mostly integrated with macOS features (basic keyboard shortcuts, file dialogs). Minor omissions or less common mac features may be overlooked, but usage is still comfortable.        | Core OS integration is functional (open/save dialogs, partial shortcut coverage) but does not extend to more advanced macOS features.                                              | Limited OS integration; uses generic Electron dialogs, few or no mac-specific shortcuts, and minimal synergy with system-level features.                                            | Ignores or bypasses typical macOS workflows (non-native menus, broken shortcuts). The experience clashes with user expectations for a desktop environment.                           | No macOS integration to speak of; app feels entirely foreign to Apple platform norms, disregarding standard system behaviors entirely.                                               |
| **7. Accessibility & Inclusive Design**      | Keyboard navigation, screen reader labels, and color contrasts are fully supported, meeting or exceeding Apple and WCAG guidelines; thoughtfully designed for a diverse user base.                                 | Proactive about accessibility: well-labeled UI elements and workable tab navigation. Some advanced features (e.g., ARIA attributes) may not be fully polished.                        | Basic accessibility is addressed (e.g., tab order somewhat logical), but missing key details like alt text or consistent labeling hamper certain user scenarios.                     | Accessibility is inconsistent; large portions of the UI lack appropriate labels or keyboard focus. Users with assistive needs face moderate difficulty.                              | Very little accessibility consideration; many controls are unlabeled, color contrast is poor, or keyboard navigation is broken, leaving a sizable portion of the audience excluded.    | Completely inaccessible. No alternative text, no keyboard support, no color contrast standards. Users relying on accessibility features cannot use the app in any meaningful way.    |
| **8. Overall Aesthetics & Polish**           | Presents as a refined, professional macOS-style Electron app that feels truly native and minimal. Typography, spacing, and visuals show attention to detail and brand consistency.                                  | Offers a well-polished look with strong visual coherence and minimal style discrepancies. Mostly feels on par with a dedicated macOS application.                                    | Moderately polished, but occasional visual mismatches (e.g., inconsistent fonts or leftover web styling) reveal its hybrid nature.                                                  | Overall design appears partially complete or rough in places; inconsistent brand elements or leftover placeholders degrade the user’s impression.                                   | The app feels sloppy or unfinished, with mismatched styles, clashing fonts, or inconsistent color usage that undermines any sense of refinement.                                      | Lacks any semblance of a cohesive design or brand; the UI is chaotic and unprofessional, failing to meet minimal standards of polish or aesthetic harmony.                          |
