## Overview

ContextCraft is a desktop application designed to help developers easily format and export their code for sharing with AI models like Claude, ChatGPT, and others. It provides an intuitive interface to select specific files from your project, generate file trees, add custom instructions, and export everything in a well-formatted manner that preserves context.

## Installation

### macOS
Download the latest `.dmg` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/flight505/ContextCraft/releases) page

#### Alternative Installation Method
You can also download the `.zip` version instead of the `.dmg`. The ZIP version might be easier to open on some systems:
1. Download the latest `ContextCraft-[version]-arm64-mac.zip`
2. Double-click to extract it
3. Drag the extracted ContextCraft app to your Applications folder
4. Follow the same security bypass steps as with the DMG version

#### Important Note About Security on macOS
Since ContextCraft is not signed with an Apple Developer Certificate, you'll see a security warning when trying to open the app. This is normal and doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the application. To install:

1. Download the `.dmg` file
2. Double-click to mount the disk image
3. Drag ContextCraft to your Applications folder
4. When you first try to open the app, macOS will show a security warning
5. To open the app:
   - Right-click (or Control-click) ContextCraft in the Applications folder
   - Select "Open" from the context menu
   - Click "Open" in the security dialog
   - You only need to do this once; subsequent launches will work normally

Alternatively, you can:
1. Open System Settings
2. Go to Privacy & Security
3. Scroll down to the "Security" section
4. Click "Open Anyway" next to the message about ContextCraft

**Why this happens**: Apple requires apps to be signed with an Apple Developer Certificate ($99/year) and notarized for best security. We've chosen to distribute ContextCraft without this certification to keep it free and open source. The app is still safe to use; you're just bypassing Apple's verification system.

#### Installation Screenshots

<details>
<summary>Click to see what to expect during installation</summary>

1. Initial Security Warning:
   ```
   "ContextCraft" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
   macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.
   ```
   
2. Opening from Context Menu:
   - Right-click menu will show "Open" option
   - A dialog will appear with an "Open" button
   
3. Privacy & Security Settings:
   - Look for the message: "ContextCraft was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer"
   - Click "Open Anyway" button
   
Note: These screenshots are from macOS Sonoma. The exact appearance might vary slightly depending on your macOS version.

### Windows
Download the latest Windows build from the [Releases](https://github.com/flight505/ContextCraft/releases) page. You have two options:

#### Option 1: Standard Installation (Recommended)
1. Download `ContextCraft-[version]-x64-setup.exe`
2. Double-click the installer
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. The app will be installed in your Program Files directory
5. Launch from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut

#### Option 2: Portable Version
1. Download `ContextCraft-[version]-x64-portable.exe`
2. Move the .exe file to your preferred location
3. Double-click to run directly - no installation needed
4. Can be moved between computers or run from a USB drive

#### Windows Security Notice
When running for the first time, Windows may show a SmartScreen warning:
1. Click "More info"
2. Click "Run anyway"
This happens because the app isn't signed with a Microsoft certificate. The app is safe to use, but Windows shows this warning for all new/unknown applications.

#### System Requirements
- Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)

2. **Choose Files**: Select the files you want to include
